# Smart-Safety-Helmet-for-Coal-Mine-Workers-
This helmet is designed to detect harmful gases, such as carbon monoxide (CO) and methane (CHâ‚„), in coal mines. It is equipped with sensors that continuously monitor gas concentrations, providing real-time alerts to ensure miner safety.
# Problem
From the early days of humanity's need for energy, coal mining has been both crucial and controversial due to the inadequate safety measures for miners. Explosions in mines are often caused by the presence of gases like methane, carbon monoxide, and other hazardous substances. The dangers of underground mining include suffocation, gas poisoning, roof collapses, and gas explosions. To address these risks, we have developed a Smart Safety Helmet designed to protect coal mine workers.
# Abstract
I have designed a smart helmet using a NodeMCU ESP8266 microcontroller to monitor hazardous gases, abnormal temperatures, and humidity levels within coal mines. The helmet is equipped with a temperature sensor, humidity sensor (DHT11), and gas sensors (MQ4 and MQ7) to continuously assess conditions in the coal pit. The enhanced safety features of our system significantly improve the miners' chances of survival by providing real-time alerts about potential hazards. Using IoT technology, we have developed a template in Blynk that displays real-time data on temperature, humidity, and gas concentrations in coal mines. The system sends notifications whenever these values exceed their respective thresholds, ensuring immediate alerts in hazardous situations.
